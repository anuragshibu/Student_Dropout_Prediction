# Student_Dropout_Prediction

The Student Dropout Prediction project is a machine learning-based system designed to predict and identify students who are at risk of dropping out of school or university. This tool can help educational institutions intervene early and provide necessary support to at-risk students, ultimately improving student retention rates.


The primary goal of the Student Dropout Prediction project is to create a predictive model that can forecast whether a student is likely to drop out based on various factors and historical data. This tool leverages machine learning techniques to analyze student information, academic records, and other relevant data points to provide early warnings about potential dropouts.

I have used Naive Bayes classifer algorithm in this model because of the behaviour of the data and we know that naive bayes works best on textual data .
